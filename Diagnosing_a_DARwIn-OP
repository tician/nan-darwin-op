	-Kinda.
		Does the servo horn rotate by hand when it should not?

			There may be a power issue.
				Are you on battery power?
					Is the battery charged?
					How old is the battery (how badly abused)?
				Are you on AC power?
					Is the power supply adequate (12V-5A minumum)?
					Is the barrel connector snug?
		Do any servos suddenly stop responding and/or go limp, but not the
		  entire bot?
			Probably a loose wire (the cable protection in the butt often pulls
				the connectors out).
			Still not responding?
				Does the servo light its LED when first powered on?
					Does it show up on the dynamixel bus?
					Is servo 1 flaking out a bit, too?

							voltage reset.

					-Yes.
						Likely a broken gear.  Send an email to arrange to
						 bring in the DARwIn-OP to get it fixed.

				 DARwIn-OP to get it fixed.
