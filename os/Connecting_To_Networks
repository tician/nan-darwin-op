It is very likely you will want to connect to a wireless network.  If you 
want to use NetworkManager, then run the 'x11vnc.sh' script on the
DARwIn-OP.  On a different computer connected to the DARwIn-OP via ethernet
cable, execute the two commands listed later in the init script.
This will open up a fluxbox session where you can use the nm-connection-editor
GUI to create as many connections as you want easily and hopefully without
interference between network devices (there have been a few times where the 
DARwIn-OP would get stuck during boot waiting for a network connection).
Right-click anywhere to open the menu and select 'Applications->Terminal
Emulators->Xterm' to open a terminal and run 'nm-connection-editor'.

After a connection has been created with the gui, connecting with the
command-line tool is simply:
>sudo nmcli con list
which will output all available and existing connections.
To connect, enter:
>sudo nmcli con up id CONNECTION_ID
where CONNECTION_ID is the name of the connection to use.

nm-tools and nmcli will produce errors if used over ssh without being
preceeded by 'sudo'.


All else fails, use the above gui method to disable autoconnection for
each connection on the device.  This should allow
'/etc/network/interfaces' to override Network Manager's access to
the device (will probably cause problems with not being able to use
two interfaces eth0 and wlan0 simultaneously, if you do not already
have that problem).
