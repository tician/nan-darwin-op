Please, let's keep things neat and easily upgradeable.

When you upgrade:
	1) Move _all_ of the contents of the current framework version ("Data",
		"Framework", "Linux", ".svn" and "ReleaseNote.txt") to a folder
		named with that framework's verison ("v1.4.0", "v1.5.0", etc.).
		This folder will likely already exist with a copy of that verison's
		zip file within it.
	2) Download the new framework and create a new folder using the framework's
		version as its name ("v1.6.0", etc.) and move the zip to that folder.
	3) Extract the contents of that zip file to the "/darwin" folder
		("/darwin/Data", "/darwin/Framework", etc.)
	4) Copy your project's source code for that new version to a project folder
		in the "/darwin/Linux/project" folder.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT UPGRADE SERVO FIRMEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As of v1.5.0 of the framework, the MX-28 firmware is older than the version shipped on new
servos and the firmware installed by RoboPlus during calibration.  Installing the old
firmware will wipe the calibration settings and potentially damage a servo if the funky offset
is not caught quickly enough.  Servo #18 is the worst affected, but there are others.


Upgrading servo firmware:
	1) Upgrade the framework and install as above.
	2) Open a terminal and enter:
		a) "cd /darwin/Linux/project/firmware_installer/"
		b) "make clean && make"
		c) "sudo ./firmware_installer"
			1) type in password if prompted ("111111")
			2) when prompted type "1" for upgrading CM-730 first
			3) when prompted press the reset button on the DARwIn-OP
			4) wait for it to print out "success" and "Terminated program"
		d) "sudo ./firmware_installer"
			1) type in password if prompted ("111111")
			2) when prompted type "2" for upgrading MX-28T's
			3) when prompted press the reset button on the DARwIn-OP
			4) wait for it to run through the list of servos to upgrade
				(now is a good opportunity to visit the vending machine)
			5) verify all servos were upgraded successfully.  You will see
				many lines reading "Reset ID:N...Success", where N is the
				servo ID.  It it failed, check the servo cables and
				repeat step "d"


User projects
	TellDarwin has a text file located in "/usr/local/bin" named "td"
		This file allow the user to call TellDarwin from any location
		 via the command "td".  If you change the path of the project
		 folder, do not forget to upgrade the file or you will get a
		 "file not found"/"no executable" error.
		As of 2012/06/05, this is looking for:
