UGA Theatre/Engineering modified DARwIn-OP Framework + TellDarwin MAX interface

Description
-----
Mostly here just to make things easier when setting up after upgrading a 
DARwIn-OP to Ubuntu 12.04-server.  I had too many files scattered over too
many machines and it offered one more opportunity to learn to use git.

Features
-----
- Adds startup and shutdown sounds.
- Installs required packages for the DARwIn-OP framework.
- Installs required and/or useful packages for TellDarwin.
- Creates sym-link at '/usr/bin/td' for TellDarwin binary.
- Anything else? Not sure.
