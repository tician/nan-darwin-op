INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILATION

TellDarwin uses the ROBOTIS framework v.1.5, which can be obtained at 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinop/

TellDarwin also uses the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) user-land library, which must be installed before TellDarwin can be compiled. ALSA can be installed with:

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev 

Then move the folder containing this file and all of its contents to /darwin/Linux/project/

and enter

make

If that does not work then use the documentation in doc/ to get more help.
